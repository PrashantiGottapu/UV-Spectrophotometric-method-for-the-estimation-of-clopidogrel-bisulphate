UV-Spectrophotometric method for the estimation of clopidogrel bisulphate
A few among the numerous analytical methods available for the estimation of clopidogrel
bisulphate (CBS) are reported and the methods used in the present investigation are described
in detail in this section.
Estimation of clopidogrel bisulphate: Clopidogrel bisulphate is, chemically methyl (+)-
(S)-α-(2-chlorophenyl)-6, 7-dihydrothieno [3, 2-c] pyridine-5(4H) acetate sulphate. The
methods available for the estimation are not official methods. Literature review revealed
various analytical methods for the determination of CBS earlier are either in single or
combination with other drugs analyzed in bulk and pharmaceutical dosage forms. These
analytical methods were briefly reviewed below.
Pravin B C et al 1 reported on the development and validation of spectrophotometric method
for clopidogrel bisulfate in bulk and formulations. Anandakumar K et al 2 developed a
reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography method was developed for the
simultaneous estimation of aspirin and clopidogrel bisulphate in formulation. Lakshmi
Prasanna I et al 3 reported on the spectrophotometric determination of clopidogrel in the
presence of asprin (Clopin-A) and its assay by charge-transfer complex method using 2, 3-
Dichloro-5, 6-Dicyano-1, 4-Benzoquinone (DDQ). Patel R B et al 4 carried out studies on
simultaneous estimation of acetylsalicylic acid and clopidogrel bisulfate in pure powder and
tablet formulations by high-performance column liquid chromatography and high-
performance thin-layer chromatography.

Construction of calibration curve for clopidogrel bisulphate
A spectrophotometric method based on the measurement of CBS absorbance at 220 nm 1, 5 in
distilled water, 0.1 N HCl (pH 1.2) and phosphate buffer (pH 6.8) was used in the present
study for the estimation of CBS in different samples.
Preparation of stock solution
Accurately weighed 100 mg of clopidogrel bisulphate and transferred into a 100mL
volumetric flask, few mL of methanol was added to it for complete solubilisation of drug and
then the solution was made up to volume with distilled water/0.1 N HCl/ pH 6.8 phosphate
buffer to obtain a stock solution of CBS containing 1mg/mL concentration.
